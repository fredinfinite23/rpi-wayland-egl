Buffer passing Proof-of-concept
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a tiny app demonstrating inter-process VC buffer passing cability/sanity

To show proper functionality, the following controlFlow is used :

parent process (transmitter)
----------------------------
 1- Create a pipe for inter-process communication
 2- Create the receiver process
 3- Create the buffer to pass over using vc_dispmanx_resource_create
 4- Fill the buffer up with random values
 5- Compute buffer checksum (CRC) and print it out on stdout
 6- pass buffer handle over to child process

child process (receiver)
------------------------
 7- Wait for the piped handle from parent
 8- retrieve dispman buffer image pointer via passed-in handle
 9- Compute buffer checksum (CRC) and print it out on stdout


Buffer was correctly accessed from the child if the two
printed out checksums are identical.
